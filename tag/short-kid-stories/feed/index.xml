								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6 style="text-align: center;">&#8211; Beautiful story of Reema.</h6>
<p>Reema was a poor girl who lived in a small tent all by herself. The only way to earn her money was to go to the nearby factory called &#8216; Cadbury &#8216; who&#8217;s owner was very mean and rude. Reema went to work as usual. Miss Parkison, the factory owner made Reema and her fellow coworkers stand in a line. &#8220;So?&#8221; Asked Miss Parkison with a sickly sweet smile. She looked around as though expecting someone to shout &#8216; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day">APRIL FOOLS</a>! &#8216; . And in a blink of an eye she roared “get to work!!!” and she walked away. <span id="more-920"></span></p>
<p>Everyone but the supervisor scrambled to their seats. Tasha &amp; Rohit, Reema&#8217;s best friends complained to her as though she was their leader and gave her a headache. Reema returned home at 3:25 am and fell asleep immediately. A tiny gnome walked over to Reema&#8217;s bag and sniffed it. Slowly more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnome">Gnomes</a> came and began to sniff it, hopeful for some food. They found some chocolates and gnawed it in an instant. But they did not know that the chocolates were for Reema&#8217;s lunch.</p>
<p>The next day , Reema opened her bag for her chocolates but instead they were replaced by wrappers by the Gnomes. “oh well, if someone has stolen it then it&#8217;s alright; I can try to get some more for myself.&#8221; Hearing this leader of the Gnomes was very pleased with Reema. She had forgiven the Gnomes even if she was hungry.</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">Cosmic blessings!</h6>
<p>&#8220;Oi! Every gnome, listen to me. “He told the other gnomes. “Since that Reema girl forgave us, we have to help her in return. Any ideas? “Several hands shot up in the air.”Yes? Sir- er?&#8221; He asked a funny looking gnome with a wooden leg, an eye patch, a chunk of his nose missing and a silly Red hat with a stuffed elephant on top. “I am Cadogan . I ain&#8217;t gonna be helpin much but ah thinks we should help er with er works. Yeh agrees with meh? Eh?&#8221; &#8221; Err&#8230;everygnome in favour of sir Cadogan, raise your hands.&#8221; Said the leader.</p>
<p>A 3/4 of the group raised their hands. &#8220;Yeh see? Ah am great! Yeh ain&#8217;t gonna change the idea. Got tha leader chap? Who needs this meeting today. Every gnome ain&#8217;t need it. Yeh leaders.&#8221;Shouted Cadogan. “Miss Jean, my dear secretary, tell me, where does Miss Reema work&#8221; Asked the leader. At the Cadbury factory down Street, Chapman road ,#307,sweet lime layout. “Replied the Secretary as though bored.” Righto, Jean “cried the leader cheerfully.  It was clear that he thought Reema an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel">angel</a></p>

REEMA</h6>
<p>He then said “come on! The faster we go the faster we get there!&#8221;</p>
<p>**********************************************************************************************</p>
<p>Reema came home as exhausted as she had ever felt before. She still had extra work to do but accidently forgot to do it and now the factory was closed. She had to go and face her doom sent by Miss Parkison tomorrow. But now she couldn&#8217;t know when was tomorrow for she fell asleep.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-922 aligncenter" src="https://lastspacefighter.github.io/lapizlazulai/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Unicorn_205-133x300.png" alt="Reema and The Gnomes" width="133" height="300" srcset="https://lastspacefighter.github.io/lapizlazulai/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Unicorn_205-133x300.png 133w, https://lastspacefighter.github.io/lapizlazulai/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Unicorn_205-456x1024.png 456w, https://lastspacefighter.github.io/lapizlazulai/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Unicorn_205.png 513w" sizes="(max-width: 133px) 100vw, 133px" /></p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">EXHAUSTED LEVEL 4</h6>
<p>***********************************************************************************************</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the Cadbury factory down Street, the Gnomes were at work. “This is tiring&#8221; complained about gnome named Dean. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Dean at least we are good at making chocolate.&#8221; Said a sympathetic female gnome. “Sigh. You are right Sara&#8221;. And he continued.  The leader was bustling around instructing and helping. “oh, come on Cadogan. Help just a little. &#8221; &#8221; Ah ain&#8217;t helpin no gnome if ah don&#8217;t get nothings, fudge&#8221; and soon 7:00 came and the Gnomes left the factory.</p>
<p>***********************************************************************************************</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">The Punishment</h6>
<p>Reema was ready for this. It was her doom. She was not going to survive. With a sinking heart, she left her tent house and cycled towards the factory. Miss Parkison was waiting for her. “I seem to have just heard from Emilia that before leaving she found your work INCOMPLETE.  I hate incomplete work, Reema and you seem to have put a toe out of line.</p>
<p>Punishment: a hundred lashes on your stomach and back. Now, excuse me, I have to see your work. A minute later the police arrived. &#8220;Hey, little girl. Are you Reema Kapoor? ““Of course &#8220;replied Reema” well congrats you get one billion dollars and $90000000 as extra young lady.&#8221; “W-w-what?! You m-must have made a m-mistake.&#8221; Stammered Reema. &#8220;Nah, go on, Miss Parkison is under arrest. An odd little bloke came to my office 15 minutes ago and told me everything, now go and take this:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">CUTE       LITTLE     BLONDE      CAT</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, thank you officer, will my friends be alright too?” Asked Reema. &#8220;Yes&#8221;</p>
<p>While walking to the electronic shop, Reema was shocked to be told that her work was complete? But who did it? thought Reema. The Gnomes were planning to tell Reema that answer. But that is another story!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">THE END</p>
